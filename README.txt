Performs gene-set analysis with MAGMA, using gwf.

MAGMA: http://ctg.cncr.nl/software/magma
gwf: http://mailund.github.io/gwf/

The workflow is run by calling run.py with a number of arguments.

It is necessary to have prepared the studies from which the gene p values are derived prior to analysis. The file studies.csv contains information about the studies publicly available from the PGC. (https://www.med.unc.edu/pgc/results-and-downloads)
